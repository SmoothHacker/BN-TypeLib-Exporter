# BN TypeLib Exporter

This plugin compiles exported functions and its corresponding types into a type library. Right now, it's a button in the UI 
titled `Export As Type Library`. A pop-up window will show detailing what options you would like to specify. Options include 
alternative names(libcurl.so.5.0.0, libcurl.so.5, libcurl.so), dependency name, and the path where you want the library exported to.

## Future Plans
